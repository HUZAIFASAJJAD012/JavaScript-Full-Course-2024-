arithmetic operators along with their symbols:

1. Addition (+): Adds two numbers.
   Example: `5 + 3` results in `8`

2. Subtraction (-): Subtracts one number from another.
   Example: `5 - 3` results in `2`

3. Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
    Example: `5 * 3` results in `15`

4. Division (/): Divides one number by another.
   Example: `6 / 3` results in `2`

5. Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of a division operation.
   Example: `5 % 3` results in `2`

6. Exponentiation (**): Raises the first number to the power of the second number.
   xample: `5 ** 3` results in `125`

7. Increment (++): Increases a number by one.
   - Example: `let a = 5; a++` results in `a` being `6`

8. Decrement (--): Decreases a number by one.
   Example: `let a = 5; a--` results in `a` being `4`
